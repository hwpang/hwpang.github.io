I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Green group](https://greengroup.mit.edu/) at MIT Department of Chemical Engineering. My research centers around developing detailed multi-phase kinetic models, generating large-scale high-quality quatum chemical dataset for transition states, and building machine learning models to predict radical themrochemistry and solvation energies.

I'm currently the lead developer for [Reaction Mechanism Generator.py](https://github.com/ReactionMechanismGenerator/RMG-Py) and [Reaction Mechanism Simulator.jl](https://github.com/ReactionMechanismGenerator/ReactionMechanismSimulator.jl).
