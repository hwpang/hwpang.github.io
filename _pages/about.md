I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Green group](https://greengroup.mit.edu/) at MIT Department of Chemical Engineering. My research centers around developing detailed multi-phase kinetic models, generating large-scale high-quality quatum chemical dataset for transition states, and building machine learning models to predict radical themrochemistry and solvation energies.
